Project Title: Stock Price Prediction and Automated Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

Description: Designed and developed a Python-based dashboard to analyze stock price trends and perform sentiment analysis on
relevant news articles for a selected company. This project integrates APIs, data visualization, and sentiment analysis,
empowering users with critical insights into stock performance and market sentiment.

Key Features:
Stock Price Analysis:
Utilized the Alpha Vantage API to retrieve daily stock price data for a selected company (e.g., Amazon, Apple) and stored the data in a structured format (CSV).
Implemented Matplotlib visualizations to plot historical stock prices, dynamically scaling the X-axis (dates) and Y-axis (close prices) for better readability.

Automated News Sentiment Analysis:
Fetched real-time news articles related to the selected stock/company using Google News' RSS feed.
Integrated the VADER Sentiment Analysis module to analyze headlines and determine the sentiment polarity (positive, neutral, negative).
Displayed and stored sentiment-scored news headlines with metadata (publish date, source link).

Data Storage:
Saved fetched stock pricing and news sentiment data into CSV files for future use or detailed analysis.

User-Friendly Enhancements:
Handled varying data formats by dynamically processing date and numerical fields.
Implemented techniques for clear visualization, such as limiting X-axis ticks, formatting Y-axis values, and dynamically scaling graphs.

Technical Stack:
Programming Language: Python 3.12
APIs Used: Alpha Vantage API, Google News RSS Feed
Libraries:
    Data Processing:    Pandas
    Visualization:      Matplotlib
    Sentiment Analysis: VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer (NLTK)
    Data Storage:       CSV format for stock price and sentiment details

Goals and Challenges Addressed:
Ensured proper handling and transformation of raw date fields into readable formats for plotting.
Customized graphical visualization to prevent overlaps of X-axis and Y-axis labels.
Automated filtering of meaningful news headlines by applying sentiment thresholds, ensuring only impactful pieces were presented.

Outcome/Key Takeaways:
Demonstrated the ability to integrate external APIs and perform robust data analysis.
Showcased proficiency in dynamic visualization to assist in uncovering trends in stock performance.
Developed a comprehensive automated workflow for fetching, analyzing, and storing market-related data.
